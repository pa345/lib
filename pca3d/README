There are two chains of programs:

stage2a - read TIEGCM 3D current grids, compute FFTs of windowed time series at each grid point
stage3a - use FFT results to build spectral density matrix for each frequency band, compute SVD
          to get principal component vectors

=====

stage1b       - read TIEGCM 3D current grids, perform Mie decomposition to represent them in spherical harmonic form
stage2b       - read SH coefficients from previous stage1b, perform windowed FFTs and store FFT data to disk
stage3b       - use FFT data to build spectral density matrix and compute SVD

print_fft2b   - print result of stage2b windowed FFT data to files suitable for plotting
spectrogram2b - print spectrogram of stage2b windowed FFT data
print_modes3b - print 3D spatial modes to files suitable for plotting
