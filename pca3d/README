There are two chains of programs:

stage2a - read TIEGCM 3D current grids, compute FFTs of windowed time series at each grid point
stage3a - use FFT results to build spectral density matrix for each frequency band, compute SVD
          to get principal component vectors

=====

stage1b          - read TIEGCM 3D current grids, perform Mie decomposition to represent them in spherical harmonic form
stage2b          - read SH coefficients from previous stage1b, perform windowed FFTs and store FFT data to disk
stage3b          - use FFT data to build spectral density matrix and compute SVD

print_SH1b       - print SH time series from stage1b results
print_map1b      - print lat/lon and r/lon maps from SH coefficients from stage1b results
print_spectrum1b - print power spectrum of SH coefficients from stage1b results
print_fft2b      - print result of stage2b windowed FFT data to files suitable for plotting
spectrogram2b    - print spectrogram of stage2b windowed FFT data
print_modes3b    - print 3D spatial modes to files suitable for plotting

invert           - model fitting and inversion program
invert_postproc_lcurve - use output of 'invert' to generate L-curve for regularization
