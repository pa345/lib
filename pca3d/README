There are two chains of programs:

stage2a - read TIEGCM 3D current grids, compute FFTs of windowed time series at each grid point
stage3a - use FFT results to build spectral density matrix for each frequency band, compute SVD
          to get principal component vectors

=====

stage1b - read TIEGCM 3D current grids, perform Mie decomposition to represent them in spherical harmonic form
